# Flashcard Service

## Description

The Flashcard Service is a component of our learning platform, managing flashcards. 
These flashcards consist of multiple sides, each containing text, images, and customizable labels. Functionalities are follows:

1. **Querying and Creating Flashcards:** Users can create and interact with flashcards, customizing the content on each side.

2. **Question and Answer Designation:** Users can designate sides as 'Questions,' determining which side they need to guess first.

3. **Spaced Repetition:** The service utilizes spaced repetition to determine when a user should study a flashcard again, based on their success.

4. **Learning Progress Tracking:** The service tracks user progress with flashcards, success rates, and suggesting future study intervals.
